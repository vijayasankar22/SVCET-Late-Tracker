- Primary color: Dark blue (#1E3A8A) for the header, login page, and main navigation, creating a sense of authority and reliability.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6E9F2), a very slightly desaturated version of the primary hue, to keep the overall interface calm and professional.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A), approximately 30 degrees 'left' of blue, to highlight key actions and elements such as buttons and active states.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure modern and easy readability.
- Use soft shadows and rounded corners for cards and buttons to create a modern and approachable interface.
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.
- Consistent and clean icons from a standard library (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different functions and data types.
